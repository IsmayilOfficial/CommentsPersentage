Top dmais algum BR ?


Drake needs to drop a whole album with this type of vibe

Here when the Raptors won their first championship ?
who here after drake announced this coming to all streaming platforms?
who’s here after he announced he’s dropping Care Package

Who here after the Raptors championship win. ?
The Raptors should’ve played this as they announced the starting line-ups for the NBA Finals
I can load every gun wit bullets that fire backwards prolly wundnt lose a single rapper... Line was fire

When drizzy dropping 1AM in Iraq? Any of you lot know?
Who’s here after listening to War
The song that Drake haters pretend doesn't exist... ????
Back when Drake was one of the most consistent rappers.
No artist can beat this drake.

Alright fam. It’s been nice seeing all of you on here for the past few years but we finally got this on streaming. Our time is here. I’ll see you boys on the other side.
listening to this in Toronto at 5am
THE TORONTO RAPTORS ARE GOING TO THE NBA FINALS! As a Pacers fan all I got to say is Beat the Warriors
Why did I find this in November 2019?
 Holy shit this is good.
Who knew Siakam is the best player in the NBA ????????????

Drake - 5AM In Toronto ft. Drake
Every bar was straight fire. GOAT


Omertá reminded me of his flow on this
most drake ft drake underrated ass song bruh
2019 NBA CHAMPIONS
Years latet and it STILL sounds like Drake ft Drake
yo someone needs to really diss drake so her drop a hard diss track on them
I swear Drake has a few tracks like this he's just WAITING to unleash at the right time.

All them boys is my Wills

Dis song is greatly underestimated?
'' I COULD LOAD EVERY GUN WITH BULLETS THAT FIRE BACKWARDS.....
PROLLY WOULDNT LOSE A SINGLE RAPPER'' LOL
DRAKE IS HUMBLE AND ARROGANT AT THE SAME TIME I FOLLOWED HIM SINCE COMEBACKS SEASON AND PEOPLE FORGET A LOT WHY HE SNAPS.... HE KNEW PEOPLE WILL COME AT HIM CUZ OF HIS CONFIDENTS...  ( CONFIDENT ) PEOPLE DONT LIKE THAT SHIT
Still his best song lyrically
This is MVP Drake

???

Who's here cause they're known of this song for years? Not just because it's on Care Package..
Why can‘t he just release more music like this? It‘s one of the best rap songs of all times in my opinion.
This still hard to damn???
this song soildified drake as the GOAT he's surgical with his verses



The drakest Drake song ever
Drake is the greatest rapper of all time 
The fact that he doesn’t use auto tune makes him A MOTHERFUCKIN LEGEND
His flow is immaculate
2019 June. Still fire stop sleeping on Drizzy
Wish this was on Spotify
The most underrated Drake song!! Glad it's getting a re release!!
Drake can really spit when he want to ??
That classic “aww yeah” at the end
I wish all of Drakes music had this sound


That bullets going backwards line is literally insane 
Damn is it me or did Nicki Minaj actually get finer over time?
Can’t believe this was released 3 years ago and still goes hard till this day 2020 BEETCH
WHo is here after her son went on live saying he's tired of people saying his mom left him over a stack lmaooooo
Who’s here after Remy said people recite the “What kind of mother leave her one soon over a stack” line to her son? ?
Nicki won the beef because she is still relevant you only know remy now cause of her dissing the queen
???????????
???????????
??????????????
??????????????
Who's still going to be here after nicki gets married and has a baby?
Basically things nicki said in her verse were worth more than remy's whole song.


You know it's real when Drake has his turtleneck on.
everyone being serious in the song
lil wayne: iM a diNosAuR
Here after Remy said her son got bullied at school because of the “what type of mother leave her one son over a stack?”  line ?
What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?!! ?



This make me wanna fight the chick that stole my crayon in 3rd grade.

This song was hella underrated should’ve been at least top 10 on billboard
Remy’s career is STILL recovering ?

Drake is starting to look more and more like a cuban drug lord ?

It’s funny that this is a diss to Remy and Nicki won this one cause Nicki didn’t need to rap for seven minutes to talk shit that no one really cares about
man if nicki would keep that facial expression of her first verse here.. on more songs.. damnnn she looks unbothered and powerful
imagine walking over westminister bridge and seeing nicki
When you don't see her twerking she is serious. edit: tysm for 2.1k likes
QUEEN!  END OF DISCUSSION!
2019 ish!
I’m still here in 2044 listen to this song with my future kids ?
She doesn’t get older she just gets better
“ I woulda helped u out that pit you felon” she kold ash??


Nicki looks exceptionally good on this one 
Slaying as always 
Forever The Queen
Nicki is hands down gorgeous my lawrd
Nicki such a Queen it physically hurts she retired. My girl gonna go down a legend

NICKI IS STILL THE QUEEN.
Years later and Nicki still ate her tf up on the calm ! ?
Can we just take a moment to appreciate NICKI'S LOOK? Her hair and make-up look so fresh and beautiful .
Nicki is the QUEEN OF RAP?????????

Nicki is the damn queen wow
Anyone see when she smile she has dimples
can we just respect how beautiful Nicki looks in this video
Nicki will always be rap queen and no one can  ever replace her

Who is here December 2019. 
Blue press if you love nicki
i guess u needed a pap “ ????????????
nicki’s relationship with ellen is honestly hella cute
This took me back to such a weird time in my life
I still love the fact that Ellen is in this song
I'm sorry she roasted Remy with this
Who else here listening to old songs after they found out she’s retiring? ?
She's actually a GENEROUS queen. She be payin for her fan's student loans and shit like YAS GIRL

Drakes line about laying off wine and nicki getting finer overtime really went over a lot of people’s head
DAMN! Everybody was saying Nicki career was over cause of Sheether but no frauds tho...we’re all them at when Nicki murder somebody.
She looks so much like Lauren London in this video omg??? but who’s here in 2020?
anyone else like when she walks and her heels make that noise??
Here after Remy’s son live ??
She will forever be queen PERIODDDD
It's funny how everyone in 2017 said her subs were wack and here  we are in 2019 with nick cannon's trash ass disses ??
What kind of mother leave her one son over a stack Rrrrrrrrrrrrrr ?
Lil Wayne has not aged for last 15 years?? 


WHAT KIND OF MOTHER LEAVES HER ONE SON OVER A STACK??
Imagine comparing cardi to this
Ask Miss Ellen!!!
When people ask whose better Nicki or Cardi? Show them this music video
The way she pronounced some of the words here reminded me a bit of roman
?Nicki Minaj?Thai Love you?
Don’t usually listen to Nicki (not a fan) but man she killed this one :o
Nicki dissing :Remy MA
Drake dissing :Meek
Weezy comparing himself to a dinosaur!


Nicky: I'm retiring 
Me: (google) nicky songs
Also me: Nicky 24/7
Queen of Rap. Merry Christmas
You already know Ellen is gonna edit herself in the video when Nicki Minaj comes on the show

You guys here going back and forth with each other and this happened like 2 years ago stop talking about the past now cause nobody cares about this s fued anymore its long time story bout this and the peoples that you guys are talking about don't care about this anymore its quite obvious because Remy ismliving her life and Nicki is living hers as well so you guys should just lay the petty bullshit to rest
And Nicki still THE ??

Good throwback ??
I know Drake is no biggie or Pac but in my opinion in our generation he is one of the new legends. He can literally take ANY song and make it catchy. My goal is to produce for him one day or get him one of my beats. Take a look at my stuff if you feel like being kind.

When you're listening to songs that are making you feel old even though you aren't really old
Absolutely fallen in love with this song -  when he sings the chorus just makes me so emotional? 100% want as my wedding song one day
This is what it's like trying to find my mom at the damn grocery store.

I remember hearing this song while walking down the Isle with my wife on our wedding day. Best day of my life... I have no regrets choosing  this song on our wedding...
It's almost Christmas and still in love with this song 2019

Who are on nostalgic feeling today ? 
2019
This is a good song for me because I am in a relationship with someone that appreciates me for who I am
Anyone listening to this beautiful song in November 2019?

I've been losing so much time

Gavin & Stacey Memories!
This is mine and my little boys song. Love you Oscar James
I want to marry a girl that listens to this kind of songs in this generation.

12:32:00 AM
What day is it? And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive
I can't keep up and I can't back down
I prefer this music rather than the new music It had music feeling in it

The best thing in the world is to love. Too bad that love does not always win in the real world. This saddens me.
10 years ? 
I like it from SMALLVILLE.
Theme to my wedding in the future
I saw this song for the first time in a fanfiction about justin bieber lol good old times


06:02:00 PM
This song is so beautifully addicting
Just one thing comes to my mind when I listen to this: Smallville!
So beautiful nothing like it now a days lol
This music is for my future wife wherever she is one day when I meet her I’ll show this videos and show this comment ????? luv ya future wife that I haven’t meet yet
How can one song make me feel this way about someone. Cause that someone found a way to make me happier than I feel when singing this song. I’ll learn it on guitar one day for her though.
When I get married me and my wife will dance to this song
3 things that've happened to me today:
1. My friend told me he hates LIFEHOUSE.
2. My friend got hit by a bus.
3. I lost my Bus driving licence.

Whenever I listen to this song I always picture Clark Kent & Lana Lang dance. 



This song would fit nicely into the John Wick Universe.
Fun fact: Richard Patrick(The singer) is the brother of Robert Patrick(The actor) who played the T-1000 in Terminator 2!

that crazy bass riff deserves its own grammy
i see Jim Carrey psychotically dribbling a basketball #jimcarrey

R. Budd Dwyer a man with no shortage of balls. He gave his life to save his family and expose the truth. Suicide is not something I like but he had a noble cause. RIP Budd.

If this song was a drug 
Name the drug 
I came because of Mordecai Playing Basketball in the atmosphere
'Who told you to come here? Did the Zero tell you to do that?' ??
This chorus riff is the same as Stabbing Westward song Ungod because ITS THE SAME GUITARIST . Nobody stole anything from anybody .
Can’t get enough of this even after all these decades...
Patrick's voice is basically a distortion pedal.
when you make a par in golf
I brought myself here.





Your life matters

The equal contrast between Mike and Chester's vocals is what makes this lyrically beautiful song an absolute masterpiece.
Okay
Who agrees with me if they love Linkin Park thinks that this music is better than some of today’s rap songs
Me: Jamming out
Mum: Is that someone screaming...
Me: Yes..but in a cool way
Here I go for the thousandth time.
Best tampon song ever.

Step one : turn volume to 100
Step two : skip comments
2:49 . I hate this part!
What you heard:Just to throw it away
What i heard : chester throw it way
It’s kinda weird seeing Mike with a guitar when you’re used to seeing only the newer songs as videos but damn I almost forgot the older videos...
Anyone Listening it in 2018? or am I only one :|

I found a guy in the metro of Paris listening this song on his headphones so high that i could hear it too. Was a good travel but he looked very sad :(
Sadness: 100
Depression: 100

I think the last time I heard this I was a depressed ass 16 year old. Now I'm a depressed 23 year old... I guess not much as changed
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal

That helmet is full with Radiohead fans tears
Friend: Why can you hold your breath for so long?
Me:
I can’t describe how this song is making me feel. It’s hit me somewhere so deep that I feel like I’m having hundreds of emotions and none at the same time... numb but on fire 
Never felt this way from a song before
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you

People talking about being depressed and watching this at Christmas 2019....
No surprises there.

Everyone's talking about how the song makes them sad but i just keep thinking about the human condition in the 21th century when hearing these lyrics

Fun Fact: Thom Yorke actually drowned and died in this video


2019.....and FOREVER!!!!!!!!!

Fun Fact:  The part of the video where Yorke is submerged in water was filmed in high speed and played back in slow motion for the video.
This video is breathtaking....
haha...
y'know...

Whenever I'm underwater and staring at a sunbed...
I think of this song
14 minutes til Christmas 2019 and I'm listening to this...
Thom Yorke is one of a kind. One of the finest vocalist. This is possibly one of his best works.
the only upside to being depressed or feeling lonely is that Radiohead sounds way more sweeter.
Congratulations to Radiohead for the 100 million views on No Surprises (13/dec/2019)
What a great song.

i bet who ever listen to this song have real problems in his/her life that can't be shared to anyone.
1:50 my brain: stop tilting your had back and accept your fate. You're just prolonging the inevitable

I used to to call this the ding dong song when I was like 3 so whenever I want my dad to put it on I say put on the ding dong song
This whole song is good but nothing hits me like that intro

Esta canción es mejor que toda la carrera de Ozuna y Maluma
Today I feel my chronic depression has come back again

The dislikes are a representation of the government!

1:55 super chin be like

It took me a life to realize the harmonies during the last chorus are Thom saying “let me out of here”.

This song and where it is in the album to me has the same effect as All Apologies on In Utero
that's the song my dad chose for his work alarm. Took me time to understand since I didn't speak English as a child but now I find it really funny and ironic. I love it.

I’m not depressed but this song always makes me shed a tear. Beautiful......
Why this song hit different ???

Am i the only one who find this song uplifting?
Its feel like its about a man tired of his boring life and decided to find a better new life

I can't remember how many times I listened to this track on my car's tape recorder in the late 90s.97-98. Reverse&play days.

Ok computer=best album ever
so tired = 100%

these songs are liked by a certain kind of people.
This song is like a soft pillow where you can rest your head after a whole big-bang inside your heart
I always like to hold my breath with thom and see if I can beat him
This song is actually very positive 
Someone acknowledges their hurt and weary self
He’s telling them he wants to be home  safe and secure 
Arrest this job that slowly kills you


My dad showed me this and I could feel my eyes water and my heart break

this song can change my mood from happy to sad in 0.0001 seconds.
How can a song have such light hearted melody yet be so sad and lonely.
Bruises that won't heal....
Me: Am I Sad?

NO SURPRISES LYRICS 
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you

Song pops up on recommendations
Me: Wow I haven't listened to this in years..
Every time I here this song it reminds me of what my crush is NOT thinking of me but for someone else
Okay besides the meme...doesnt this gives a nostalgic 90's vibe?!

these people who don't win American Idol actually go farther then the ones that do he is truly talented and so is Adam Lambert
I gotta admit it Daughtry is so much better than Taylor Swift.
the early 2000's were like the best times for music
does he ever make a bad song. real music from the soul.




His voice is captivating cant stop listening....
this guy needs to make a comeback.
One of the best songs released in the last 10 years.

this is what you called real music.. it comes from the soul..
reason why am glued to rock music!
Its been over a decade since this released! Lets all just take a second to appreciate all the wonderful music Daughtry has made for all of us to enjoy over the years :)

Driving down Nostalgia Lane. Just passing by.
Musical genius that's all i gotta say. Oh and also Simon was a moron for turning his american idol audition down.
Daughtry is like how Evanescence is I can't stop listening
his music is underrated ???

This is the best song that Drake has ever made in my opinion
This time drake needs to go save A$ap rocky? #freeasap

She look like that hot fish from shark tales

I played this to my girlfriend when she was drunk at a party she just laughed at me lol
is this a gta v mission?
“Make it hard to spot the general by working like a soldier”
Fredo in the cut that's a scary sight
I wish drake made more of songs like this. Like I’ve said the old drake is the best drake
Y’all I just realized that ASAP rocky was here and he looks exactly the same ??????
5 years later and I just noticed ASAP rocky was in this video
At least she looked cute when she got kidnapped tho...
This song brought back memories! When I had a thing with a girl I really liked back in freshman year this song was like my victory song but I was not victorious at the end of the day?????
August 2k19 anyone??just me ? Aight cool
Whenever I see someone mention the year they’re listening to this with “2k19” I think the basketball game.

7 years this video has been out and I’ve just realized the guy drake killed was working with them.
To this day I can’t get over that girls beauty.
Its always the white guy that turns out to be the bad guy lmao

The intro is longer than my relationship ..
The nostalgia hits at 4:58
Imma come back in a year like this so I remember
Someone should turn 6:33 into a beat for a song!
Y’all at 3:00 that’s how I stare at my homework
I wish this song was in gta 5 it would be perfect when your cruising around the hills.
2020 damn this song brings so many 3rd grade memories????
1:23 R.I.P.   Fredo Santana ! ?
I forgot about the “drake the type of..” ?
In more than 50k comments if you find mine you're a legend ?


Had to listen to this one more time before the decade ends
This song takes me back.  Remember what life was like when it first came out?

2:33 to start the music
Why does nobody acknowledge the fact that Fredo was in this
I Love when he tells Drake he is a rat and Drake start staring at him threw the rear view mirror ???


This is a throwback I even hear it on the throwback station
Someone special dedicated this song to me?
If They Going Home They Mean Buissness About How They Defeat Mercenaries vs Criminals and She Is 
Victim Of Despised!!!!!


so many memories.... late 2013 was really something.
Song starts at 2:30. You're welcome. My balls hang low. That wasn't even necessary but now you know.


Drake the type to stop at a red light in GTA V
Nostalgia. Never even knew this was Drake.
This go will go down as 100% classic in history.. Amazing!

Yo went to war for her my boyfriend won't even go to the store for me ?????
I never knew that A$AP ROCKY and FREDO SANTANA was in the video
6 years later im 11 now...
6 years and I still don’t know what his friend told him in the car... ?
2020 still going to be bumping this shit ?
When your mom picks you up from school
Me: I had a bad day a bully picked on me
Mom: just hold on we're going home
My Father and Grandpa made this video and the special effects
I just came here bc I wasn't know about this song and I wanna listen a different song of Drake.


This my first time seeing this video drake shooting a hk was beyond hilarious ???????????????
I remember this song always coming thru the ?
Anyone honestly thought of this music video as a movie? Lol.
I got lost in this it made me cry I miss the old drake?
Just hold on we're going home
Homeless people: Are we a joke to you?

@Matt Steffanina you can afford to properly censor the N word. Lots of young people watch your videos.
Every time I hear someone say ohhh I can do the box dance I refer them to this like na braaaahhhhh

Great job everyone!!!!  Looks easy but I know it's not.  Effortless!!  Great choreo!!  Thanks for sharing Matt.

That’s a fun dance! They did awesome
I can do all that after a little bit of bang
The ones that seemed so easy where still SOOOO HARD

I’m black and I honestly don’t care. As long as they don’t say the word then it’s fine. It’s ok if they play it in a song because their not verbally saying it.
All the dancers look so innocent and then they start poppin hard!

Even when white people dance cool they end up lookin goofy
I like how everyone gets to do their own thing in the end. It makes it way easier to watch the same dance multiple times in one video without getting bored.

Love how Bailey incorporates the woah in different ways in each of her freestyles! She can do no wrong in my eyes! Love her ?
4:41 I like the the girl outfit (left girl)

He has to do “thru the night” - jack Harlow. It’s a good song so please like so he can see.
2:32 they were probably my favorite I think
nicole is good at everything
4:44 (girl in the black and white sweats)
She's gonna be successful in the future if she keeps it up. I've literally seen her grow she was a little girl when I first saw her
BAILEY MY QUEEN

Queen bailey strikes again. And that’s just on periodt!??????

Another example how black america rules the world.....we gave everybody the game.
Bailey ???
The white girl with the bun is literally my arch nemesis... And I dont even know her. I know she is just doing her thing so I feel bad about being a hater but her vibe throws me off
The black dude is a legend ? he literally broken his  more then once without filling pain ? I feel for you ?
Charli damelio could never
The girls face at 5:07 is soo funny
5:32 these girls did the dance the best ???

Damn those two asian girls weren't even born when Vince Carter did that dunk ?
Bailey's freestyles stay giving me chillllllllllsssss

Roddy Rich: (watches this) y’all stick to the dancing I’ll stick to doing the ee-urh

Did u notice at the end sage from dancing with the stars junior was there 
3 years ago my grandpa died so i listened to this song on BGT
in 2016 my best friend died in a accident so i watched this video 
2017 my dog died so i watched this video...again
2018 my girl broke up with me so im here again

Simon : I’m about to start this man’s whole career

Hey. Nothing happened to me. I just like the song....
Who just randomly felt like listening to this song ?

I remember me and my mum used to listen to this song in the car when it was a hit. She joked to me that “he must be really lonely dancing on his own then.”


we fall in love with the people we can never have

The lyrics of his version.
Somebody said you got a new friend
Saddest comment section I've ever been through
Never forget: this is Robyn's Song. For those who don't know it.
WHO'S HERE ON 2020?
Anyone? No one just me right??
Who is here On Jan 2020 ??
This is why simon hit the golden buzzer.
So Calum made the exactly same slow version that Robyn made before?  He is a perfect copycat
Love you grandma carol but now I can't do it love you see you in the end


Scott eres lo mejor ?? en Chile se escucha mucho tus canciones eres lo máximo

to the 1% who's gonna read this


It's hard falling in love with your best friend because you know that you're just a friend.

? No ? one ? cares ? what ? year ? you're ? listening ? to ? this ?
He's cutie and adorable he's my hunny I am attractive to you Calum scott

im at corner watching you kiss her. that really hits different.

Calum Scott and Lewis Capaldi need to make a song together.

Do you think you will ever make it? 
I wanna cuddle everyone who feels saddd??
“Dancing on my own”  a phrase many of us go through in life unfortunately.
I’m here to listen this song again in 2020 when I’m thinking about my life...

Anyone else agree?

I just break up with my Boyfriend ....we’ve been together 3 years 
But uhmm ?
??? ?????? ??????? ??? ????? ????????

Who else is here after midnight because they just wanna listen to some emotional music?
He looks like Chris Pratt and Tom Hardy had a baby.
Isn’t this a cover of Robyn’s
The masked singer brought me here?????? GO KANGAROO ?
How does this get 65 k dislikes is what I’m wonderin lol
good song.
A song about unrequited love.

Who is here after 29 Dec 2019
we fall in love with the people we can never have
I keep dancing on my own
true for all
Será q mais alguma brasileiro(a) passou por aqui?
Amo esse cara ?
Algum brasileiro aí?
This dudes voice puts me in tears   cuz you can feel the pain in this song
This song's now one of my favorites
If you're reading this 
It's going to be okay. You're going to be okay. It gets better I promise ?

1:33 broken buttholes?!?!?!
Shoma Uno brought me here and I'm so happy I've discovered this man's music. ??

Pregnant woman dancing: like a god
Baby inside: WTF IS GOING OOOOOON!!!!

Pregnant woman can still dance better than me*
That baby is like “is this a roller coaster” ??
Pregnant woman:*dances like a god*
Me:*can barely walk elegantly *

Everyone: that pregnant lady dances so good!
Me reading all these comments and knowing who the girl is in the second clip and the 4th clip: do these people not know that it’s Chachi??
1:45 was that just my eyes or was that baby moving a whole lot after that :0 ?
* Pregant women dancing like a goddess *
* baby *
-“wtf stop playing wtf stop playing” ...
Still can’t believe that you didn’t make it on the YouTube rewind list.
Matt Steffanina  is like a Santa Claus for many dancers around the world this years dances were litt loved all the dances of 2019??
Edit : OMG !!!! 318 likes thanks so much?
Kaycee and bailey always snap it
Imagine if that woman wasn’t pregnant and we’re out here thinking she is...
Pregnant Chachi: dancess like a goddess
Me:.....
The baby in the pregnant women 
Baby:earthquake earthquake earthquake earthquake
Pregnant mama: dances
Baby: OH NO I THINK THE WORLD ENDED

everyone: wow these are good dancers especially the pregnant woman

The pregnant woman one was so cute. Her baby is gonna be a great dancer one day.
I don’t even like Kpop but Bailey was so ? and made that song work
Pregnant woman: dances
Baby: dafuq Dey doin over der
When I dance it looks like a squirrel is having a seizure
Lady that’s pregnant dances like hell and fast*
Me: MOOOMY HELPPP ARE WE ON A ROLLER COASTER

Me: *hopes I'm not gonna die when I'm in the hospital*
*Me vibin with the avengers cast the next day*:
Mom: Let's dance 
Baby:  hold my milk




I don't have any favorites.. because I love all of them
I don’t know why but I’m focused on the crowd more then the dancing
me seeing all this skinny pretty girls
DID YOU SEE CHACHI’S BELLY WHEN SHE HUGGED MATT?!?! IT WAS HYPERRRR

Who's here before 1 million ?
2019 was a great year for most people but not for me. But I am grateful I am alive and my family are well.
2019 was sooo frigging fast... I remember it was like January a month ago
Props to the pregnant lady. She was really good
I can imagine the baby being terrified to why his little home is shaking.
Lmaooo he's literally trying to put that thumbnail everywhere he can
") """"-"""""",,"
pregnant woman:Dancing and also fit

I loved all these performance!
That baby is coming out booging with some serious moves
Its hard to choose a favorite but  Bola rebola is AAAAAAAAAAAHH AMAZING I LOVE IT
How do these people dance so good I can't even dance half as good as them! ?
Woah there was a Bollywood song in it as well at 2:00. Tht was so good.

Can't wait for the 2020 content!
Chachiii ?

Brasil ??
Olha a música de Anitta 
ive been waiting for this video?
Lovee u matt??

Can I expect a collab with MJ5 ??? ??
I particularly love the dance with the little cutie in the light pink track suit ???
Idk if he’s done this yet but should do a blindfolded dance challenge where you try to teach bailey or someone a dance solely on telling them and see how close they get
My favorite was the song loco Contigo the one with chachi hope she can come back to do more dances
mama doing moves that got her pregnant in the first place lol
That momma is rocking this ??
Gj keep up ?
Nothing more unattractive then someone who dancing all cool.. while making the most UGLIEST faces ever ?????!!!

Hello I'm finally early!!!! ?????

Billie Eilish's era was too short ?
???????????????? ?? ????!!..


When everyone is naming people in the video but you have no clue who tf any of these people are.
Matt's smile whenever Bailey dances is so heartwarming

y’all talking about bailey but did y’all not see my mans will at 5:03 killin it
Bailey is the most quickest on her moves. She’s so good!!
Bailey KILLS EVERYTHING ??

NO DISRESPECT  THE BIG GIRL WENT HARD.REFRESHING TO WATCH.AND THE ASAIN CHICK WAS THE BEST


Matt look at bailey is the cutest thing ever. He’s like dad proud of his daughter lol i love them
Bailey is a psycho on the dance floor 
Thats why she choregraphed psycho
And she will choregraph more

Bailey is the quickest to think on her feet she got some mad skills there
2:02 best flowwww ???
bailey: slaying
matt: proud dad
When you think you’re the best...there’s always an asian that’s better.  Lol
The real question is where did that Asian girl buy her pants ?
How many times have you watched Bailey's part?
Me: yes
I can't imagine how many shoes creased during this.
wish that I had Bailey's energy to step into 2020 lmao. she's bomb.
edit: thank you so much for the likes!
2:03 amazing transition
when the second girl came on i was just looking at the guy in the back squatting making faces at her lmao ?
01:34:00 AM
I feel like these first movements are her trademark.

The fact that Bailey choreographed a kpop group this hits hard .


FACT

5:10 i love it amazinggg
Who else couldn't stop smiling while Bailey was dancing?
The birds when everyone dies from the Coronavirus

Ya'll ever just watch everyones facial reaction when someone does something crazy?!? LMAOO
Noo stop sleeping on will ? He killed it frfr! The way he looked at the girl though ? lmao.
wHY DOES WILL's FREESTYLE LOOKS like an actUAL CHOREO
The girl that went second straight snapped ??
5:31 is the best part of the video hands down. She went extremely hard in the pink hat and the best part about it is that she puts a smile on your face at the same.
I remember when Bailey was so little she's the best and Matt really loves what he does?
When the 5 girl sequence came on I actually said to myself out loud that I couldn’t handle it

I’m just here on my bed shouting AAAYYYYYY every 2 seconds. This was fire!
Nobody:
Comments: bailey bailey bailey

Literally every video I watch of his are so hypeeeeee! Everybody just be giving and they got good energy for sure! I love ittttt?
3:26 Why would he not tie his drawstrings!? That's so dangerous!

Half the time when I’m watching Bailey I’m mainly watching Matt react to bailey lol such a proud dad face
6:47 duo love it! fantastic! great job

Tori and will just nailed it again ?
Why am always excited whenever I see bailey on the floor
1:50 when the Coronavirus kicks

Broooo will killed it????
I love the thing that every one is encouraged to have their own style and all moves look so cool
I didn't expect bailey to coming off.She slay it so well
p/s:i know started following her after i saw her video dance Cold Water choreography by Matt Steffanina
Yall gotta respect the other dancers to. There are hella talented
Omg i really love watching Bailey Sok rock this piece ?????

BAILEEEEYYY MY BAAABBYYYY


Love Bailey from Thailand ????
That's will from FBE

who else loves the REACT channel and noticed will right away
Bailey is a queen and Gabe's and Josh's duo was perfect!
Why some people  keep saying the Asian girl ? Or chick??? For all you know she may be as American as American pie ?
5:49 dam' girl??



The girl with the under armor hoodie I thought that was my gf cause she has that hoodie
Loving how they support each other
to the guy with the post malone shirt in the back: i love you :)
I love how others join in when the best hits
They have the same choreo but the performer after Matt was something else. It looks like it's a different one. I'm guessing Bailey is the namr
The way Matt look at Bailey..Like ughhh?he looks like a proud dad?SANAOOOLLL

5:20 Yo these two!!! I had to set a marker for 4:10 so I can come back and watch these two few more times.
youngin’ in the yellow shirt of that last group killed it.
5:11 why is no one talking about how good his freestyle was?
That was litttt
The first girl in grey top was soon good and looking amazing in dancing than Matt
The dude at 9:40 is hitting freestyle pretty damn well! Love this whole video - a lot of flippin' talent! ?
I need those pants Bailey has omg
Me be like: EYYYY!!!?
So proud that Bailey was the one who choreographed “Psycho” by RedVelvet??
2:38 favorite dance
2:43 the guy wearing full black looks like that guy from that youtube channel called thebackyardscientist
yo everyone went WILD and it makes me so happy
5:35 my favorite part
BAILEY IS MURDERER IN MATT'S CLASS. SHE ALWAYS KILLS IT???
I like the fourth they’re hit me?
I love their freestyle at the end of the choreography ?
Bruh Will was poppin O F F from react 5:05

Imma have to see Bailey in person to believe she’s actually human...
Hey matt you are amazing and the other dancer can I request a dance
JUMPSHOT BY:DAWIN??

Everyone:

The second one is the best 4 me

I don't know but AC Bonifacio executed this so smooth and just suave!

That 2nd girl HITS it different. Ugh ???
1:35 min. Is there a follow-up? I really like him.
BAILEY IS SICK! I LOVE HER MOVES!!!
Im a simple man when I see big will I click

The guy in pink shirt and his partner are amazinggg????
Bailey all day errrr day! Her interpretation of Matt’s choreography is genius. Her subtleties are what makes her an amazing dancer. She knows to pull back to pull you in and the she explodes! She is such a dynamic dancer.
BAILEY‘S IN MATT’S CHOREO
BAILEY’S IN KYLE’S CHOREO
SHE IS KILLING IT BOTH!!!

I been watching these dancers since they were like 5 and the skills they have is incredible
I learned this by just watching the tut and this!
BAILEYIYIYYYY?????
2:01 THIS GIRL IS THE GIRL WHO MADE THE CHOREO FOR RED VELVET’S PSYCHO

Ellos:*Bailando a su manera*
Los de tik tok: No nos inventen esos bailes raros!??
Do they know what there going to do at the end or just random things XD
amaazzzzing choreo! watched it like a thousand times
Can we just talk about how good Bailey is!
3:45 was perfect
Matt looks like a student while watching Bailey ????wishin he got her moves ? can't stop watching it x_X 1:30
I love bailey...
Still I cant memorize those dance steps.. Urghhhh!
Bailey wears the same clothes as in Kyle Hanagami’s choreography :0 does that mean she learned two different choreographies to the same song in probably the same day?? What a BEAST

I just realize where I remember Bailey from.

Why i feel the soul of bailey dance is like Agnez Mo. Her expression too
After seeing bailey I straight went to see comment section.
Cause she killed it!!!
why I can't take my eyes off Bailey!!!
lmao not even gonna try going to the gym just gonna dance hardcore like this

I fell in love with that girl wearing the pink cap at 5:56! She nailed it! ??
The second girl stole my heart.
I'm ALWAYS for Amanda L. Gives me life!
This channel is my motivation for ejercice.
5:17 I’d break my ankles
Wow the second girl had so much style
Bailey just nailed this choreography! 
She was soo smooth like she didn’t have to hit 2:02 so HARD

I'm currently experiencing anxiety bc I thought for sure the guy in the pink shirt was going to trip over that untied pants string.
YYYAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSS TAHANI!!!!!????


This Song Sounds 1000 Times better watching this choreo
0:36 I like it
That asian girl killed it
I appreciate your influence with these young people. Good job!! ?
I am smiling the whole 12 minutes. Mad skills

Can we also talk about the plus size girl in 6:01 she was lit too
Interesting to see how the first 2 dancers used many moves i've seen BTS doing too in their routines
Did someone noticed that the guy in 4:08 is way too similar to Jackson from Sex Ed :o ???

Hope you enjoyed watching this cover! ITZY - 'WANNABE' chorus tutorial coming soon with detailed explanation~ 

Bruh for the thumb nail I thought it was actually yeji-

ellen’s closet: i DoNt ThInK sO mAtE
She has more clothes dancing WANNABE than I do in my closet
Edit:oh my god i already have 172 likes. Thank you very much


Is no one going to talk about how stunning she looked in each one of those outfits???? ???

Breaking news:There was a girl caught Stealing itzys outfit
dancing is flawless but can we just appreciate the editing and transitioning into the other outfits while maintaining the dance well done Ellen
How many outfits do you want to use in you cover?
Ellen: YES
everyone in the comment section: why does ellen have so many outfits???
ellen: iTs NoNe If YouR bUsInEsS
how does she have all these outfits?? damn she’s literally a kpop idol.
0:49 like si te diste cuenta q su camisa decia cnco :v
2:34 i thought she was Yeji ??
Ellen:
Itzy's sixth member
Blackpink's fifth member
??  ?? ?? ???? ?? ?????????? ??????? ????? ??????? ?????? ????
Ellen is someone I wannabe like lol plus that wardrobe like they have to have a whole different house for their clothes
1:50 that is literally lia and nobody could tell me otherwise. this outfit is so spot on!!!!
During Kpop comeback
Ellen: Yes
Neighbours: Here we go again 
Clothing stores: Here we go again 
Group: itzy
Fans: Midzy
Haters: Crazy

imagine being so perfect :(
Ellen’s closet: how many outfits you want in this dance cover?
Ellen: y e s.
I almost choke my popcorn. I'm still learning ryujin's part and here she is afgh@#_#*#
How many outfit changes do you want?
Ellen: Yes
1:56 I thought that was Irene for a second
I was just wishing that plz god let ellen do the cover of 'wannabe' and post it today 
Now here i am.......

2:19 is when you dropped your eyeglasses and try to find it
Brian: how many outfit changes do you wanna do? 
Ellen: yes

ellen has all the rights to be herself!!!

Ellen’s closet must be heaven with all the dance cover outfits she serves us ?
Its crazy how we can tell who she’s representing just by the outfit changes
she's one of the few people who makes covers that doesn't look cringey at all
Others cover dance : your moves are lit etc
Ellen's cover dance : she have so many clothes ??? 
I'm starting to worry how many clothes have you got
Anyone here binge watching wannabe dance cover to see if they did Ryujin's shoulder dance justice ? Ellen brought salvation
she should make Closet Tour like.. HOW YOU HAVE ALL THOSE OUTFITS DAMN?

I REALLY FIND IT CUTE THAT BRIAN EDITS HER COVERS LIKE...  wish we all had brian as our boyfriends u knoe
How many outfits do you want for this cover?
Ellen : yes
When u still can’t figure out how to move your shoulders that quickly ?
Ellen:*trying each and every outfit in th MV *
Me:*wait she forgot those pants of lia she wore while ruining each and every thing in that dining room (ps JYP regretted that)and she acting all innocent*
Edit: don't hate me i still love the way she exactly looked like yeji in the thumbnail ???
1:21 How was that transition so smooth ?

1:21 hands down one of the best transitions EVER
When I say smooth transition.. 
Y’all should say ELLEN
your wardrobe is amazing and all but how did u memorize the choreography so fast??? dancer's have this amazing talent of memorizing quickly kksskskks <3 i loved this video!

JYP: Someone's stealing ITZY's outfits.
Ellen: zyes

I tried like 10 seconds about this coreography and for me is impossible to learn ? I dont know how you can learn all this dances
Could you please cover do or die by Alexa? She is underrated but the choreo is bomb!!
When I clicked the video I actually got a AD of Wannabe xD
Midzy's when Itzy has a comeback:(includes me) OMG I LOVE IT THE GIRLS ARE SO TALENTED AND THEY SLAYED THIS COMEBACK
Ellen: WOW the song is so good and the choreo is so good! starts practising the choreo

The last dress was oustanding....
When do you think she'll release a tutorial???
The amount of effort you always put into finding matching outfits to the outfits the idols wear in the mv is amazing.
You know your a true Ellen And Brian fan when you recognize some of the outfits from their previous videos...! #applause


0:25 only Ryujin can do this shoulder popping and she is only a lead dancer like...wtf?
Hi Ellen I’m not sure if you’re going to see this but I would love to see dremacatcher scream cover they’re very underrated Nd they deserve the recognition
Now I'm really curious how behind the scenes look like. Well we all know that Ellen is clumsy lmao

I still remember how they make these kind of covers the struggle is real HAHAAHA. But overall KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK ELLEN AND BRIAN FOREVER SUPPORTING THIS LOVELY COUPLE
I hope you'll make a tutorial for the whole choreography of itzy's wannabe
1:22 WOW THIS TRANSFORMATION ??its soooooo damn good
How many clothes will you use for this cover? 
Ellen: Yes

I got the actual ''wannabe'' music video as an add for this ''wannabe'' dance cover 
Her level of cover is idol level ??? u can see how she slay at ryujin 1st part which is shoulder dance ? i find is so hard and i dont see yet anyone slay that part other than ryujin and she is the 2nd person. ??


This why I never get tired of watching Ellen and Brian dance covers??. They are on another level ???.
I wish Ellen Unnie having a back up dancers hehehe.. Ellen faster learner .
Ellen did it again! She always nailed every single kpop dance! She's the most talented dance cover queen I ever watched on YT! And of course Brian's amazing edit in every single dance cover they did. Both of you really talented married couple. Love you two much and be careful of Corona Virus guys...
I literally thought that was yeji on the thumbnail

Make the dance cover of MCND's 'Ice age' please

No one notices the ‘Ellen and Brian’ sign at the stairs-

THAT WAS UNDENIABLY AMAZING??EVERYTHING WAS SO LIT ASF?
1:21 damn that was one of the best transactions I've ever seen on this channel
2:19 When you dropped your eye glass and your ellen.
1:21 DANG THAT TRANSITION IS SO DAMN SMOOTH TF ?
ITZY after 2-4 months : FINALLY WE DID IT                             Ellen the next day :
2:28 i feel like that there is somebody behind her ????
I just want to know WHO THE HEK DISLIKING THIS AMAZING TALENT?!
She isn't a great dancer... at least not to the level of Itzy
Who are actually clowned by the thumbnail and thought that it was yeji? 
1:22 the transition was so S M O O T H
I can't even walk with heels how can she dance with them ?!
How is it possible that when she changed outfit she was in the same position and spot? 

1:38 this screams everglow bon bon chocolat era
I noticed her move fit with itzy's style more than Lisa's dance style
When you haven’t watched it yet but knows it’s good and gives it a like
1:22 THAT TRANSITION WAS SO SMOOTH OMG
It's like she's the last ITZY member they forgot to include :o

ngl this is one of ellen’s best covers
I’m literally saying “YEEES WORK THOUSE SHOULDERS” like she can her me ???????
Not offending but it is true that Ellen covers dances but later but her dance is better than Lisa Rhee even though she covers faster (personal opinion)
I LOVE how Ellen pays attention to the smallest of details. I almost thought it was Yeji’s dance practice because of the outfit in the thumbnail?
I clicked on this video because........I THOUGHT ELLEN WAS YEJI OMG LIKE ASHXNYSHSYNSYHSYHSYSYHSHS YOUR THUMBNAILS AND VIDEOS ARE SO GOOD THAT THEY LOOK LIKE KPOP IDOLS.
i thought it was going to be a tutorial but omg how r u so perfect
2:17 ellen your hair (?°?°?) but still look good !
Let's focus how amazing the editing of Brian was in every video.
Can u do  alab/burning by sb19 if u want :')
Ellen: remove everything in the living room I’m dancing
I swear she learns choreographys faster than my wifi

Elle you deserve my 3:26 minutes ????????
Guys she’s tryna distract us from the crazy amount of power outlets she has in that one room

Like si notaste que en el tercer  atuendo su blusa era de cnco :'u 
Like si hablas  español xd
Their dancing skill really do amaze me will u guys ever do singing cover 
And i also love Brian editing

I initially thought she was acc yeji for a sec?
Can u guys plss do a cover of Kick It NCT 127?

YES!
1:22 that transition is so SMOOTH
No one:
Me: do Itzy and Ellen shared closet?
HOW DO Y‘ALL MAKE THE SHOULDER MOVE OH MY- KNWKSNS
1:21: magic ???
Your edit skill is great.
??? ?? ??? ? ? ???..?
I really wanna learn the chorus for this dance but I don’t understand from anyone except u so could u pls do an explanation and tutorial for dance
BRUH other dancer coverers get one outfit in two days but ellen and brian get eight outfits ready in FOUR DAYS WTAF
I just got Itzy Wannabe MV as beginning advertisement :v

When you’re doing SOLO but still in a GROUP! Thank you Ellen and Brian
Could you ever make a fanmeeting  in cologne? It would be so cool..
I still wonder how someone could have that many pairs of clothes


2:33 I'm very impressed in the transition in this part
2:33 i thought she's yeji for a second
last night i wished that you’ll do a dance cover of this song . My heart is soooo happy right now??
I'm more entertained by the outfits than the dance itself.
I still cant get over her outfits and hair don’t know y
HOW COME ELLEN HAS SO MANY OUTFITS?! LIKE C'MON I WANT SOME!!!
the dance and transitions being as crisp as ever /chefs kisses/
0:48 Ellen con la camisa de CNCO?
Another amazing cover!!! The outfits are gorgeous! One thing I have with the choreo itself is that some of their moves have been recycled from their previous comebacks and I can't tell if this is on purpose because they want to connect the three comebacks together as one era or if they got kinda lazy (not Itzy but the company/ choreographer). I hope the next comeback/ era gives them the opportunity for new concepts etc!! :)
I can't stand the beauty of Ellen cause she legit looks like Yeji from the thumbnail OH LORD JESUS I CANNOT breathe— ?
EEBEE10  +   PYQGDS  =  12~15% Discount on Yesstyle  ??

h-how does she get these outfits ready so quickly. like-
I freakin dont know that shoulder movements on the intro dance it seems hard.
I really love the effort they put in every single cover they do!
I find really satisfying when she is dancing in the fur jacket ?
Sooo.... Itzy is 6 now oh theres new member named ellen oh ok
How many times she changed her outfits .Its so gorgeous
Did you steal yeji's coat???? just kidding???

She should enter to nizi project that jyp is working right now


1:22 the transition is so smooooth omg
1:21  I wasn’t ready yet?
how does she look like every memeber in tbe outfits
She  was a bit late on posting. I think it was because of the choreo as it is really hard to remember.
She did really well. She always amazes us.

1:22 is the best transition I have ever seen
okay but the extra time and effort she put into her wardrobe changes and editing ????
The transition at 1:21 was perfect
Your dance looks even better than the original and the timing of changing your clothes is also so perfect. Just everything in this video is good ??

Ellen you killed it!!  HANDS DOWN FOR OUR QUEEN????????????
does anyone know a good place to buy knee pads for dancing? like Ellen has in her 3rd outfit... much appreciate the help

Do you have to move a couch away every time you film? Or do you watch Tv standing up?
??????????
All her outfits are BEAUTIFUL! I always look forward to looking at her outfits when it comes to their dance covers. I also noticed she was wearing a CNCO shirt ? My cousin was going crazy when she saw it.

This is the one of the best covers I've seen so far and the outfits?!?  Yesss!!
I have so much respect for both Brian and Ellen after watching how they film these covers with the outfit changes. They serving us not only DANCE but also VISUALS. SO MUCH TIME is committed to making these! Great Work!

I don't like your clothes or you now but I use you and do you know why I don't like you no more and your music because you changed
In my opinion I think this song is trash but she is getting better and too much autotune I really don't care if y'all come for me in the comments but someone had to tell her goodnight
This song is trash bro i was happy for nothing im going back to megan
I THINK  this song is about debo 
where are you all listening from?
Por min daria mil likes ?
Basically Frieza's Song for the Saiyans. xD
This song reminds me of manipulation.
When it says: And when your done I'll make you do it all again.
I love this song I can play this over and over
Amo essa músicas ?
Ng??i Vi?t Nam ?âu ??
Cho tôi th?y cánh tay c?a b?n ??
the people would love this song because it has a good music track
Idk about you
but this sounds like the type of song to have a nightcore version and then be used for ship slideshows in 2012.
Sounds like Erik Cartman's version of Jennifer Lopez LOL
I just LOVE music
Corona virus is dancing now o yeah hahahahah

Sorry Lisa we have another main dancer- Rosé's hair
ROSE-LIKE?????
JISOO-LIKE?????
JENNIE-LIKE?????
LISA-LIKE?????
Jisoo Queen ?
Jennie Queen ?
Rose Queen ?
Lisa Queen ?
Rosé needs to be in a pantene shampoo comercial
they are 5 dances here. Jennie Lisa Jisoo Rose and Rose's hair
And the best dancer award goes to Rose's hair ?
Rosé s hair needs its own fandom !! Can we call it hairsé!!!??
For new blinks:

Jennie & Rosé : Let's wear pants and not tell Jisoo and Lisa
Lisa & Rosé : Let's wear long sleeves and not tell Jisoo and Jennie
Lisa & Jennie : Let's have a ponytail and not tell Rosé and Jisoo 


0:28 rosé
I'm sorry but my eyes are glued on Lisa. She's so talented
Lisa's legs are so fit. 
Rose's hair is on point.
Jisoo is so poise.
Jennie got the angst.
Who's your bias?
Lisa?  Jennie?  Rose?  Jisoo? Wrong. It's Rose's hair

Lisa the main dancer
Rosé’s hair: Hold my blondsé
Rosé is on fire????
Jennie: Rapper
Lisa: Dancer
Jisoo: Visual
Rosé: Vocal

Lisa the main dancer that you are today and that body girl damn
I don't know why Lisa is discriminated against been Thai ? Why Rose called skinny?
Why Jisoo for her voice?
And Jennie for been lazy? Just why?

Jisoo barely gets any parts 

Damn rosè your hair is my new bias.

Love rose?????????
Fun fact: Lisa's legs is my new religion

Rosé's hair is a masterpiece
Some haters: Jisoo is ugly
Jisoo in her first part: so smart. (Korean part :P) You are
?keep fighting against the haters Jisoo!?
Rosè's hair flips are everyythingg???
By seeing lisa she didn't look like maknae while dancing cause she is so amazing but inside she is so adorable 
I love her ??????
0:14 Lisa Waacking so gooddd!!!????? Attack BLINKKK ??
No one:
Not a single soul:
Lisa I know you don’t read my comment but I’m very love you Lisa my heart I think you’re my sister I love you I hope you read my comment ??????

Rosé and jisoo: “lets both not do anything with our hair and not tell them”

Lisa's ponytail flying up and defying gravity at the last part of the choreography is so satsifying. I keep repeating the video just to see it over and over again. 2:55
like si hablas o entiendes español!
espero no ser la unica latina viendo esto :(




Please can we appreciate Rosé's amazing skills ? She is my bias =D
i love rose .iiiiiii love black pink
BLACK PINK IN YOUR AREA
BLACKPINK DANCE PRATICE COMMENTS:



Can I steal Grandma Rosé’s hair uwu
Edit: oMg tHaNkS fOr tHe lIkE!

Blackpink rosè
Lisa always ready for anything who needs help just call her name n she will come kicking the door???
Lisa's legs are better than my whole damn future.
Rose???
I especially like the girl with black boots
Lisa: I'm the main dancer
Here I'm kicking the door!
Rosé hair: am I a joke to you?
Here I'm swaying in the air!
Tbh rose is a rlly good dancer
OMG Lisa so powerful dancer every one knows. And Rose prove that she is lead dancer ?????

Damn......this dance practice's views r more than most of the real mv 's of kpop
BLINKS R DEFINITELY SOMETHING..........

nobody is talking about jennie so let me comment about jennie. she looks beautiful and is full of energy
Lisa with them hair extensions look so damn good! But I like her short hair too hehe
Jisoo though!
'Lets all wear shorts and not tell Jennie'
'Lets all hide our socks and not tell Jisoo'
'Lets keep our natural hair color and not tell Rose'(?)
'Lets all have short legs and not tell Lisa'
There are double dancer inside rosé self???. Her Hair has its own soul.


Lisa and rosè is proving that they are the one of the best dancer of K-pop group ????????
Latinas? 

??ROSE??

Coming back here again after not getting comeback :(
Fun Fact: 
me: tries to innocently enjoy one of my interests       my suppressed ED: ?
Lisa wears short pants and shows off her long and flexible legs in dance moves.
Look at Lisa's body is so perfect
Mama mia near the end I saw a move wich looks like a dab for doing the best dancing
Can Jisoo get some love like- ????????
Jisoo’s my bias!!

I get totally wasted with LISA’s long legs. She is so beautiful with her way.

Un dance practice..con 230M...
? ...
Gustas de mucho pero xq eres lamentablemente tambien muy repudiado ..??


I liked it when LARRAY was in it
Am I the only one who think Lisa’s body is so damn hot !! ?????

who can't wait for blackpink to come back. I hope Blackpink will come back soon. blackpink is very potential to hit the world music. blackpink is the only Asian girl band who is able to go global in a short time and has many achievements in the world. blackpink songs are very good and can be enjoyed by all people. I hope YG entertainment releases a blackpink studio album with lots of songs. blackpink is very talented and charismatic.
Aaaah :3
