Fantastic!! Cuales son los ingredientes del arroz
Wow chicken looks cooked a lot more than I used to see yaasy
Hummm mais que delícia de receita parabéns menina
Hola saludos desde Puerto Rico
May I marry you
You cook with some much oil and you are not fat at all...wow
Washing veggies after chopping into small pieces is completely wrong that it cause to wash away many nutritions from it according to nutritionists. Apart from that this looks delicious
COOKING DELICIOUS RICE VERY GOOD POLIN RED
I really love the work she
does !!

What is the thick black sauce she is adding.please comment me.
Bonjour sais trés bon que vous faite bisous

Am I the only one who thinks it's illegal to call it pancake dough instead of pancake mix
Imagine if they forgot to record
How do any of these help you cut costs  This channel is hilarious - 64m subscribers How many are bots
Who put this on to go to sleep to
14:34 how to cook perfect eggs
Me:HowToBasic
edit:omg i get a like
This makes me hungry.
5 minute crafts- pancake mix in a waffle maker and calls it a craft*
Me-
1:27 gave me trypophobia
I think I'm about to pass out by how good their food looks

Plot twist: all of those real life vs. Commercial tactics were used in this video
I would like to know how these cut cost in any way 
These are the same hacks as your other videos with a new title just to get views I'm done watching the same thing over and over again just cuz you give it a different name
ive seen nearly all of these hacks about two or 3 times by watching 5 videos of 5 minute crafts i do like them and i do like there channel but they need to put new hacks in people might think different but people i know and me would like at least a new hack in each video or more but otherwise i really like you videos and i have sbscribed :)
8:49 spiders has 8 not 6 legs


Is anyone really going to take cost cutting advice from a food video that doesn't know the difference between dough and batter lol
you dirty dirty monster!
how could you put those things on pancakes!
21:38 is it just me or does that bread look moldy
9 1/2 minutes in and everything has been pancake ideas and cookie decorating. I thought this was supposed to be money saving ideas. How is making pancakes and decorating cookies gonna save me anything





It's a Arabian food
1:28 gives me the chills
10:26 why did she drink it like it was hot- it came out of a waterbottle

It looks so delicious

Guess what
2:47 was satisfying
I'm I the only persi who watches but does none of them
Moral of the story : use things the way it’s NOT supposed to be used
And I’m pretteh sure we all know dat right
2:22 tfw you’re allergic to Nutella and also you don’t like 5-minute crafts

also I try the easy things
how you gonna have all that stuff when you are camping
Best of their vids by far it's so satisfying
Almost everything is this video is really wrong...also spiders have 8 legs not six
27:10 why making frosted flakes
ya i think im good with just regular pancakes...
perfect wery god 5 minuts craft
The one with fish is slightly nasty in my opinion.
Do you make the food all on the same day If you do would that will be alot to eat in one day.
çok güzel çok baarl çok ahanesiniz
45 minutes in be like 5 min craft take 4 hours. 
Craft: I’m a rebellion!
Mwa ha ha!
the instructions are weird
These are fascinating. Some are amusing like the pouring milk into the cereal box that’s what those mini cereal boxes are designed for that’s not a hack lol but still these are fun to watch!
My hand fell asleep while o watched this
Bi insan nednnn kurd eklinde bi ey piirirkiiiiiii
2:35 ist anyone sick of the repetition it’s almost like there is no creativity left
The five minutes is what it takes to assemble the spaghetti dish.

It looks so yummy in my tummy
DONT EVER PUT BACON IN PANCAKE MIX You RUINED TWO AMAZING THINGS
Wonderful! Thanks!
i cud see this as a prank but anything else is a nope. 12:49
It's beautiful
arent you the guy who tried to hurt me with the word goodbye

1:27 tripofobia
look at the straining drink hack the second cup she used to strain into was also having a hole hahaha
How are these pancake recipes and cookie decorating ideas going to help me cut costs The title for this video is very misleading...
it pancake batter NOT pancake dough!! 





Speaking of game shows I want Sam on Hot Ones. That would be amazing.



Fun drinking game:




Silence on the stadium. Everyone looks at Sam. Sam with poker face says:

If you boil the potatoes so they're 75% cooked then roast them they'll be suuuuuuper crispy and crunchy

Sam “Oh queso” the Cooking Guy




Just run with “Take a Chance on love”

Why does he sound like he’s struggling every time he’s using that garlic press...
Recommend “A chance with Chance”
The dish looks awesome by the way.


I’ve been following Sam for a while and first thing I always notice are his badass shirts
the fork out of your back pocket part literally had me dying. and I don't even know why XD

Thought is was the Dating Game - And here they are!!!   Thank you Jim Lang


“We don’t eat with our eyes...
...but we definitely see with them.”



#chancenation #yourchancewithchance
Those frites a little hot there bud Lol
Recipe idea: 7-11 Monterey Jack chicken taquitos. I’m addicted to those things 
THE RETURN OF GREEN ONION! It's been so long since I've seen you use green onions Sam!
I get all of your references-I think it's cute.  Makes me smile!!!

I think your thinking of “ The Dating Game”
We made the steak frites last night and it was absolutely delicious

Scientist: Oil helps reduce friction and make things non-stick.
Sam: Oil will help everything stick.
I love your videos. This is no hate

“Win a chance with chance” or even “win a chance to date chance” lol gotta really play on his name since it’s Chance



I also have no idea what I'm talking about.



I would buy 10 T-Shirts IF they all say Holy Sh!t with Sam face on it lol
“I’m going to tear that up like a 18 year olds tuna”


*doesnt even use fork lmao

Max.....Daddy is so Joe Dee err tay with that “things happening in my mouth” qoute ! 
Every time I read the title I read steak fries 

Epic editing!

Hello.


Never noticed the “okay so” It doesn’t bother me. Don’t fret over it. We are going to do this for dinner! Thankyou! Looks great
Shrek. Lol. When they introduce the 3 princess. Hahahaha. “Aaaaaand heeeeere they are!”
this little canoe of pleasure is going right into my mouth
#NAME?

Sam the Cooking Guy: Steak Frites
Nux Taku: Meat n' Potatoes
“And this little canoe is going right into my mouth” - oh ok 
The whole world: dont shake hands and wash your hands to prevent the spread of coronavirus
Sam: all the hands in



I am a vegetarian. 
I never watch any cooking shows that feature meat. 
You have and will always be the only exception. 
Also.... you have re-inspired me to be a home cook.



Okay so.... New shirt!

“You’re in the presence of greatness” never have I laughed so loud! Great edit.
“Oh ques” 
-Sam the cooking guy 2020

“we don’t eat with our eyes but we definitely see with them”
#deep


Hey Sam! 


“A Chance at love”.  Should be the name of your little dating thing.
Your channel is bad for my waist line!
Boomers Rule!
how the hell does he looks like that senator from mgs:revengeance

18:21 - That was the same sound I made last night when I took a bite out of the steak sandwich I made. God damn that thing was beautiful.
Your presentation is outstanding. Nice recipe.
Sam.. yk you’re a genius when yu convinced a non-steak eating person to eat that

Nobody:
Sam: dO yOu HaVe AnY iDeA hOw gOoD tHiS WilL bE¿¿

Thank you for giving me a delicious dish that has never been eaten by you!

Just noticed that Sam and Max have 300 haters . REMEMBER when the Spartans had 300 soldiers protecting their people.  Well they are nothing like that . This is the greatest cooking show of all time !!!! Keep doing what you do !!!!
I don't know why it bothers me but I wish he had swiped the leftover ingredients into his hand and tossed it into the pan! 7:37
Say ‘ ok -so’ it makes me feel like we are having a conversation

Lmao Jilly being called a slutbong makes these episodes funny af




That saying is from the Dating game 
Mr. NOT NOT
Homie said “YASSS QUEEENNN”

You're welcome.
“You just take a fork out of your back pocket”



“It’s going right in my yacht” #pause lol love y’all’s content though
A fork and a paring knife have been my flipping friends for years.
9:20 I'm 19 and I knew that one. Honestly I just knew because of the reference in the first shrek movie lol
Better Drinking Game:  take a drink every time he says ow or ouch!

Sam! Can you make something catholic friendly for us that can't have meat on fridays during lent
Y’all need to start putting the ingredients in the description!  these recipes are so good!
The canoe of pleasure that's why I keep coming back lol
Love your channel and recipes.. BUT  I get a tad anxious when you have a knife in your hands and start cutting or wielding it in the air as you talk.. lol
I don’t know if I’m just young but the “and heeeere they are” reminds me of the mirror on the wall from Shrek that did the bachelorette game thing
If that's wagyu then I'm a flying squirrel.

“Ow. God!”
     - Sam the Cooking Guy


- SamTheCookingGuy 2020

“And herrre they are” is from shrek lol showing my age
U could use “aaaalllll rightyyyy thaaaannnn! And look at the camera. A bunch will catch on. ( and shake your head while doing so) my 4 cents !

I’m 25 so I don’t know if that makes me a millennial but HELL YEAH I watched The Newlywed Show and Match Game and Press Your Luck when I was a kid. Game Show Network was legit man!
“You’re in the presence of greatness.”  Hahahaha


I’ve said it before but we really need a “Louis/Astro 2020” t-shirt!
I'd eat that entire bowl! Great show!

I only just discovered your channel.  Guess the  Youtube algorithm finally did something right. I can't get enough and have  been binge-watching as many episodes as I can.
When watching  I feel like I am just over a friends house for dinner. But oddly never get to eat. 
 I love how you make every recipe seem attainable. I love to cook . I am no chef but I always feel like I can make all your recipes . I love how you show your mistakes too. Makes you seem more reliable. I love how much you really enjoy every bite.  But most of all I love Louis. 
 so funny watching him burn his fingers when flipping the tatters lol



Curses a lot but I mean who doesn’t while cooking Im high as well so that makes 2 of us San the cooking guy

Would be like u to do something that would be a play on words. lol

Only thing that needed for me is some blue cheese/feta/Gorgonzola crumble.


I’m making this right now.  I’ll let you know how it is in 30.

And heeeere's video of it.
(He says it 5 seconds into the clip)
https://youtu.be/hrSthPFEFrw

“Don’t Miss Your Chance”


What watch id the big guy always wearing Looks like it could take a beating.
This looks SO good
9:35 They do a reference to that show in the first Shrek movie when Farquaad is picking the princesses. https://youtu.be/mFl8nzZuExE (1:53) in the linked video
that sure is one hulk of a watch  -- what are you wearing








“We don’t eat with our eyes but we definitely see with them”



I just found a waygu farm in Texas..... definitely trying this recipe!!

Best intros on YouTube 
That dish looked absolutely amazing! Can't imagine what it tastes like.


As a knife lover it breaks my heart every time you cut with your knife on that metal top.
Has to literally SAW threw the steak with his own branded knife showcasing how dull and how little it holds an edge ...yikes
That dish has to be one of the most beautiful things I've seen in a very long time!

Is it a normal thing in the USA to keep a fork in your back pocket for whenever there's food around

17:36 it's like he's about to have his first kiss LOL
What about “ We will be back in 2 and 2”. What show from the same era
All this perfect video is lacking is a '70's porn music track in the background.



“Jesus take me now...and I’m Jewish” 

Have you ever cooked anything that’s was bad in taste but still film it as if it was delicious Or is that sworn to secrecy Lol  btw everything always look f***ing delicious
I watch this channel for the food and you end up making me Laugh my *ss off. Love this channel.

“And here they are” is outta Shrek when the mirror is showing the princesses.
Bob Eubanks: where is the strangest place that you've made Whoopi

Whenever Sam takes a bite any of his food now 
all I can think about is those two Australian contest 
winners a few weeks ago. When he gave them bites 




Max upgrading his editing skills!
Kudos!


stop calling every beef wagyu beef if it's not the authentic japansese stuff it's not wagyu beef



Sam- that line is from THE DATING GAME
Who else took the escalator down to the comment section!!!
I've learned/retained so much from watching your videos without even realizing it! 

In all technicality when we observe the perfect and beauty of our meals we truly are eating with our eyes. Very few people are actually willing to eat something that doesn’t look appealing to them in any way
Where do I find the specific measurements on the ingredients (specifically herbs and spices lol)
Sam cracks me up!  He freaking rocks!

NICE
Did u say “queso” for cheese  in Spanish or
Okay  so 
That’s be a nice shirt
Queso or okay so

This is great every time I watch it videos I wanna cook ur food while I watch it. Best thing ever I always end up having all the ingredients to make.. it's always tastes soo good.






It’s awesome how this channel is growing!! I remember when you cooked inside lol.
2 words: Looks amazing!!
Hey Sam...I just got done binge-watching a bunch of your videos. Introduced my Mom to your channel. I even went down to NotNot Tacos for lunch the other day for the first time. It was excellent!! I was hoping to see if you could do Ossobuco sometime soon Have a great week and I absolutely love your channel!!

The creativity is back after a couple of average dishes! Love it!
No one:
Sam moaning while eating

Me watching this while air frying a hot Pocket:       Ah delicious
That grill pan! Getting one of those immediately! Also this may be your best video ever. #ChanceNation
Really starting to dig Max’s editorial text inserts. LOL
It was at this moment 17:48 when I thought Sam went into cardiac arrest from all that damn grease. 
Lol I almost had a religious moment just watching you take that full bite!
Also from Shrek! The magic mirror!! Sounds exactly like that!


would be great if at the end you also add tasting by the team and their reactions 
Have you ever been told you remind me of the clear eyes commercial guy..
Also can’t wait to get my knife!
I come here for Max's editing as much as Sam's non-sense show



And awayyyy we go!
At their point Sam is just to give his haters heart attacks on a plate. Loving your work son
Yess! Great morning uploads!! Sam you’ve & Max done it again!


I like when Sam eats... He stops talking.


Sam’s riffing and wandering in thought are awesome.  Speaking to an audience that isn’t in his kitchen directly.
You are the best! Don't ever change!  My husband and I live here in San Diego and we totally look up to you and your cooking videos...you truly are helping us cook again!!
Those don't even compare to my wife's canoe of pleasure .......
I am your newest biggest fan! Love love love to cook and I can't stop watching!!! Question. Why avocado oil over olive oil for some of your dishes

just made this except once the potatoes came out i shredded some Parmesan regginao on them so it melted onto them and i also did the steak (i used grass fed angus ribeye) in a cast iron deglazed the fonde with a splash of shiner bock beer and poured the reduced beer/fonde into the butter sauce. Was amazing thanks SAM!
Damn I rolling over I knew what you meant!!! OMG Bob hell yes! Loved the video.


Sam having mouth-gasms. Hilarious! 
Get this guy some nachos since he loves queso so much
Love watching these while I'm making my gourmet pb and j
Hey man I been watching your videos since the beginning lol I love them I cooked a lot of what u have made. What kind of video editor do you use
My Doctor wants to talk with Sam about my cholesterol levels. 

AKA: how to season your fingers!
The Dating Game... and I just dated myself.


i made something similar for my family last night. i used Montreal Steak seasoning with some cayenne on the fingerlings n on the ny strip. i also did a garlic butter sauce. i will give this version a try!
Is that reall wagyu I’ve seen choice grade meats with higher marbling
3:36 I skipped again... heard some unexpected noises and Sam blowing the garlic load all over those potatoes... Things I can't unhear..
Lol. How do you get away with talking about putting a canoe in your mouth. Love you guys!!
Sam:Ladys an gentlemen we diffinetly see with our eyes
Sam:Ladys an gentlemen we diffinetly see with our eyes

Make a Sam the cooking guy fail episode that would be golden

0.44 you've got something hanging from your lip. I think it's hair.
DUDE JUST STOP SPEAKING! AND PUT CAPTIONS!! DAMN MAN
“Chance for Chance”
Newlywed Game show  ..  “Husbands.. Where was the strangest place you ever made Whoopi “.  

UP THE CULINARY RIVER IN A CANOE OF PLEASURE WITHOUT A PADDLE.
Omg I want that canoe of pleasure. Gorgeous bite size of heaven. You are funny man. If I could just get my husband cooking like that I'd be in heaven. Thanks for the drools Sam. 
Totally outdone yourselves on the editing skills within this episode. Awesome stuff.
This actually looks so good I think I'm going to make it

The reference was also said in Shrek 1 when they were made fun of the newlywed show when farquad was asking the magic mirror for the princesses

At 9:07 I thought of the mirror on the wall off of Shrek 1. LMAO. 


Been watching your channel for a while now and just want to say that you have some great amazing recipes.  Have you thought about doing a few recipes that are great recipes for picky kids lol.
Again he mixed the food with his ring on.
..

The TSUNAMI in my mouth intensifies’
So the purple guys are cool but the yellow ones are “OK”
I love this channel. The videos are so well-edited and entertaining.


I need a montage of Sam burning his mouth and fingers.
He looks and sounds like the dad from king of the hill



His reactions are always 10/10
Perfect in a toothpick Hors d'oeuvres format! thanks for this!

Could have added a cheese sauce for extra flavor. That's what I am thinking of doing.
I'm convinced Sam is high af in this episode
I love this guy. Sam is so fun to watch while I cook. I get great ideas!

A man of culture 
Just two more things: 1) Kosher saltnpepper and 2) garlic powder

Yo my mom's made your parm it was delicious thanks!
Damn now that is one of the best things you made lately


Do you ever pepper the steak after it’s done I think sometimes the pepper tends to burn. I have started salting before and adding pepper after.

Hi I am Qabas from Iraq and I love European countries and I do not know some English words and I watch the video and some way of eating very strange and I love you
I can’t stop watching the beginning oh my gosh it’s so satisfying

Did I miss something  How long does each recipe take  There's no temperature or cooking time listed.
So basically we have to wait 1 second till the food cooked That's fast •_•
Why you're make a cooking video without temperature and time 
I saw part of this video in a ad well certain parts of it in a ad
                     

EVERYBODY: OOOOO! FOOD 
ME: OOO! BUDWEISER

How does the bread get brown in a slow-cooker
5 minute craft teens: every hack we do is 5minutes
Useless without timing
Does anyone have a link for the slow cooker used
   
It looks great
average person : oh how do i cook dis
5 minute crafts : just toss it in the slow cooker
Why would you slow cook chocolates when you can microwave it or just use a stove
It's literally imoossible to brown a chicken in a slow cooker. Like at least do some research before you lie to us
Your not supposed to season your eggs untill they are done. Dummy!
So cool. Omg
Definitely doesn't take 5 mins in a slow cooker... although listing cooking times would be helpful

I KNOWWWW that tasty did not repost the recipe for that god-awful soggy behind pizza that literally looks like play dough drenched in tomato sauce smh. I thought they learned from the last video.
The music is like nails on a chalk board...
Pizza on a stove top is blasphemy
The music in these videos are getting progressively worse.. and the pizza crusts

I'm not a chef but watching this gives me shivers (not in a good way).

The mess you make after you tried cooking...
Gordon Ramsey: WHERE'S THE LAMB SAUCE 
Tasty: WHERE'S THE PARSLEY
not even a little bit of paprika in the mac n cheese is that too hard
1:34 lets be honest. We all just eat mac n cheese out of a pan
The pizza that came out the pan is different from the pizza that is sliced look at the peporoni count
This should be “how to ruin meals with parsley” 

Has anyone made that one pan pizza Really intrigued to know how the dough comes out.
This music sounds SO high...ranking! Jk music is trash 

wasn't a good idea to watch this when i'm literally starving
Love your videos they help my parents cook easy snacks and healthy snacks for us
Tasty producer: poops on table

These are the kind of videos I watch when I’m sick and all I’ve been eating is bread and chicken noodle soup for days

My mac'n'cheese sauce broke 
Well..burned the pizza crust. I’d suggest on a gas stove to heat at medium low(3-4). Not the 6 they had here


If this is their easy mac in cheese then imagine what their hard Mac n cheese is
Any chance you could tell us name of dish before you start cooking.  It would help a lot.  Thanks for all your work
It's really so easy but I'm really so lazy

O H  Y E S
Are you sure I can make that cause I’m not even exaggerating I almost set my house on fire.... making scrambled eggs.....
It looks very tasty
 And the easiest way


Why is basil always put on top of things
I don't even know how to turn on the flame
Easy they said
Anyone can cook they said
i did the pizza it's yummy

Why do they always put green stuff at the end
Imma just order a pizza-..
Another way you can make the easy 'mac n cheese' is you simply go to walmart and go to the pasta isle and buy some box macaroni
I don't understand the two thirds part
I feel like I have depressions ... Can someone please try and help me...
that crust though
Nothing is easy when you can't cook
So uncooked dough topped with cheese.....
They probably see our comments saying we watch but never make it and now they’re trying to encourage us to actuallly make the recipes

I luv this I luv tasty
At 2:50 there is blasphemy in his biggest form
I’m going to do the pizza one 
does it make the mac n' cheese more cheesey if you cook the macaroni in milk 
or is that just the way they make it
« Easy mac and cheese » I succeded to fail this. How bad am I at  -5 out of 10 probably
i made pizza one time. it was a complete fail

Wtf is elbow macaroni
Delicious
Which flour is that
Sour milk can be used to cook your pasta in! No waste!
If something involves making a dough or batter for it then it's more of a medium level of cooking than easy plus the first one is harder than cooking an actual pizza in an oven.
I wanna who actually made and TASTED the recipes. I mean for real is it tasty like they saying and whatnot 
La recette n’est pas bon vous avez essayer
Doing that pizza thing now
Wish me luck
Ratio for Mac nd cheese
Who else could hear the Mac and cheese as they were mixing it

My question is that is it really easy if you don’t have the ingredients
Bruh theres always gotta be cheese.
He clearly likes it
who else getting buildbox adds
Ace !
That's pizza is like me! An ugly mess..
is it just me that cringes when they don't season the food
That limpy soggy pizza is the saddest thing I've ever seen. You might as well use a large corn / flour tortilla as the base which will probably taste better as well with a better crunch (and it will have far fewer calories than that sad ass dough)
wow
What's with the negativity in the comments. These recipes looked quite nice to me....

I just go to mcdonalds its easier and no cleaning up to do and only takes 2 min
Any kids here tryna learn to cookI'm one of them.
To sum up the video..... Just add green spices on top of everything
Oh im the first one !!! I love pizza
you shouldn't frie anything with olive oil

if you season chicken with just salt and pepper you are going to hell
What was the first food you made
(pepperoni isn't a word. The correct one is SALAMINO PICCANTE)

I tried making the pizza and because they didn't specify the temperature my doe went black and stuck to the pan wouldn't recommend any recipes from tasty even though they look good and easy.
There is no point in putting yeast in that Pizza recipe since you basically don't allow enough time for the yeast to do it's thing.
It looks delicious with pepperoni pizza and pasta. I enjoyed the four dishes.
i like cheese
Pizza on a table without putting a plate on the bottom ew yuck

Too good

1 and 2
loule
never underestimate the inability of idiots. I've seen people overwhelmed with putting stuff in a pot.
Most eeeeuuu pizza ever
I know that pizza looked really bad but if i was hungry I'd eat it lol true story
I'd better cook other dishes cause it's harder to find the said ingredients.
This music is dreadful
Just add parsley.
10 ooo haters and 10 million subscribers
I like the video
Title:4 EASY meals
Me:Can not even turn on the stove


2 parole
Che schifo
Love video
Nice recipe !!!
that pizza is a no for me
Ya like jazz
That pizza is so sad
Hi (to all my 100% loyal friends/real family and etc.......)

I know they call it elbow macaroni but what other types of blooming macaroni are there
If anyone can cook this can baby cook this too
I mean who ever doesn’t have Marsala wine is a weird social outcast am i right everyone has that >_>
Sono italiana e se anche provo a osservare quella pizza vomito
Now a healthier one would be excellent.
Easy but the ingredient (eg: cheese) is not cheap.. Can buy a complete meal for the price of a parmesan block
The pizza is an abomination
Cosa Dio stracane ho appena visto
I'm 10 years old and that pizza looks good and easy...
I ate pringles for break
Tysm
Why so unhealthy foods
Even a baby can cook it
https://www.ebay.com/itm/401686449636
In the last one can we not add onions and wine
As a European it honestly makes me sad that you just put a load of cheese on pasta and not even make a simple cheese roux or something.. You know its a little bit more fancy but also a bit more tasty.
Nice video

How to make pizza for lazy people 
Step 1: take a pre made frozen pizza
Step 2: put it in the oven and wait for like 1h while watching the beef going on with PewDiePie and T-series

Great video but horrible music!

Im a kid so not everybody can COOK it
First

E la pasta
The recipes are good but the background music is really annoying
Cmon peoplz
All the people that hating on the pizza... simple... Dont make it Problem solved.

Thumbs up if you never cook just watch
Quella non è una pizza è un one plan e basta
what an annoying background music
I hate cilantro.  The end.
That pizza dough is going to be moister than Betty crokers chocolate cake




Anyone but vegans

I'm sorry but that music sounds like me trying to play viola but worse
That pizza is FAKE the pizza they built on the pan first has 13 slices of pepperoni! and the pizza that came out has 15 pepperoni slices!!!!!!!! like.... WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! really
Sooo..where is part 1 Could anyone give a link 
I think frozen Pizza in the oven is even better...
The pizza looks very nice but it would be better if it had crust
Why do you bother to put yeast in the pizza dough if you don't give it time to proof #pointless #learnyourshit
I don't like basils

Pizza without the crust is not crispy
That pizza looks disgusting
   
this video is ruined by the crappy music
Would you say that these recipes are
This music is horrific
Who else just watches these recipes for time pass and never cook them....
next video: pizza in a dishwasher

Nice

Ooo so easy racipi
No offence but the soundtrack is awful

Heart on my comment please
I've never eat Mac 'n' cheese. Im a horrible person
He’llo

They look good
BTS and blackpink ()
Ooohhh... Stupid Americans...
This Music is so horrible
I hate that music
Sorry but that last one was nasty
I tried the pan pizza and it was a horrible disaster
I made the pizza one. I can testify it is the worst abomination I have ever made. I am writing this comment as I look at my big plate of slop alone in my apartment. Makes me question my life.
How is that chicken left in the pot while the pasta cooks not horribly overcooked

How to make ease at Mac and cheese
1.get your friend Mac
2.get a bowl of orange melted cheese
3.pour the bowl of cheese on your friend Mac

Terrible song choice
The pizza looks disgusting  I'm not Italian but I feel so insulted 
LA PASTA NON SI CUCINA COSÌ PORCA MISERIA CHE CAZZO AVETE IN TESTA AMERICANI DI MERDA
The song is terrible
I hate this song.

Doubt the chicken in crockpot will be brown after its done.


Puts food into a slow cooker until cooked

0:38 Did anyone observe that the bottom of the egg is black
Legend says if you do this at their exact timing you'll perfect the recipe

Like if u relate
The first one was my favorite. And I don’t mean the like- 50 eggs in the low cooker
7:44 my heart broke 
Can I just say you guys always make so much food and do you even eat it all who else agreed
Hi I am Qabas from Iraq and I love European countries and I do not know some English words and I watch the video and some way of eating very strange and I love you
I can’t stop watching the beginning oh my gosh it’s so satisfying

Did I miss something  How long does each recipe take  There's no temperature or cooking time listed.
So basically we have to wait 1 second till the food cooked That's fast •_•
Why you're make a cooking video without temperature and time 
I saw part of this video in a ad well certain parts of it in a ad
                     

EVERYBODY: OOOOO! FOOD 
ME: OOO! BUDWEISER
Y'all expect me to be able to do this earlier I melted a plastic bowl in a toaster oven
Yall want a food hackfoil packs.add potato onion and other veggies of your choice. put a steak in the middle wrap it with foil but it in the oven grill or even a slow cooker.

How does the bread get brown in a slow-cooker
5 minute craft teens: every hack we do is 5minutes
Useless without timing
Does anyone have a link for the slow cooker used
   
It looks great
average person : oh how do i cook dis
5 minute crafts : just toss it in the slow cooker
Why would you slow cook chocolates when you can microwave it or just use a stove
It's literally imoossible to brown a chicken in a slow cooker. Like at least do some research before you lie to us
Your not supposed to season your eggs untill they are done. Dummy!
So cool. Omg
Definitely doesn't take 5 mins in a slow cooker... although listing cooking times would be helpful

Listen readers. I have worked in a jelly factory before so take my warnings seriously. 
No matter how strong the glass of your preserves if the internal temperature is hot & you cool the external bottle too quickly it will explode in your hands so melting chocolate like that is very dangerous. Just use your microwave with a microwave safe dish.

Me: Can we buy some fish at the store
Mom: We have fish at home
The fish at home:
these people are disgustingwhenit comes to food but me and my sisters were laughing lmao
Why are so many great videos ruined by background music It's not needed. Let the natural sounds of nature do the job. The music is very irritating.
He eats like someone will take his food
Guys these people are staging everything! These people don’t actually live in the forest. Who gets good camera equipment in the forest and they look like primitive people for the video only.
Scrolling through the comments and I see people actually thinking this guy is poor and lives in the woods... how are you gonna have million of subs and views and not be making hella cash
Me: can we go to Arby’s 
Mom: there’s things you can make at home
:
I love when there’s peaceful music as he is devouring the fish’s guts 
I can’t believe what I’m seeing on the smushing part where he cooks
New level of ASMR
The inside of  the fish is disgusting
Million of fishs are dead
i had a feeling he was gonna eat the guts too 
             
Is no one gonna talk about the sound the fish made...
You should of cleaned that guts in the fish
I kinda watch their primitive style but the way they eat!! Man !! It takes all the taste out of it!
Fish:if there was bully’s I would be friends with them if talking did not work I would knock there blocks off
Man:to late
Me:eat him I’ll eat you!
We you see how he cut open the fish
Yuck nvr wash the fish eggs 
Dat poor fish is making a stright face ohhhh lord heheh
Me: each cheeto add with song cant touch this
Also me: survival time

If I was out there I would eat it even if it doesn't look tasty
It's weird but I like watching these things bc imagine having to survive in the wild this is an actual talent if u can do all of this by yourself
If you don't even own at least a shirt how can u even afford a device for doing YT on
Whatever. I like kdeb's cooking instead! Now that boy can throw down way better 100
Where did u get fry pan in forest
As pessoas fazem isso na boa mais imagine se tivesse  te matado e seus filhos 
hey man i know it’s hard for you but stay tuff and never back down god bless and don’t let people bully you or make front of you but if they do you let them know who’s boss around there god bless

All that goodness !!!

Don’t like her new method of cooking not the recipes but the way it’s became so commercialized sorry unsubscribe
Y u have rings on your finger when u cooking though thats Unhygienic  but the cooking style is still good though
Is she pregnant again If NOT why ist that she among a lot of people wear loose clothing while not pregnant and such tight form fitting clothing while pregnant.
Dont wash or  cook food with ring on is unhigyienisch

That sad moment when you realize that the goats skin is more clear than urs
Me.  Looks through the comments to see if im the only one that feels bad for the goat but still watches them butcher it and eat it
Me: *Laying in bed at 3 in the morning watching this*
         !
Is that someone moneing I'm The background

Suprised that dog still alive
What tf am I doing I have so much homework
Cadê os de 2020
Y’all keep saying u feel bad for the goat but unless ur a vegetarian u basically are doing the same thing just not with the whole animal
The process of killing that goat by half cut neck is violance . He had feelings too how could you 

I don't understand why so much dislikes Looks like a great job!

All the vegans are traumatized right now 
I remember at happy lemon place there was a truck filled with raw goats and my dad almost nearly threw up
She is beautiful 
Será que eles comem cachorro também   eu vi que eles comem cobra ...... 
Why they gotta do mj like that
Alguien que hable español aqui
Am I the only one that can't look at this with a straight face
I didn’t even read the title all I saw was a yellow goat and I clicked :0
Tham is amazing how they  do it literally from scratch!!! Kill the animal / skin it / chop it / cook it / and eat it 
Thats why chinese are facing chronic problems like coronavirus
I wanted a skincare routine from the goat

Y'all crucified that goat 
Sweeping dirt for hours but somehow there's still dirt xD
That pure organic meat there folks!!
For vegans this video is like a horror movie
RIP goat simulator D:
Me: completing my pending work
Youtube: wanna see a random guy eating goat
         

Where are you fom
             
Wow what an experience to actually see the whole process of cooking some meat.  Sure messes with my sensitivities. At the end of the day though I’m still a carnivore. Lol
That cockerel in the back ground though knows his next. . Curry chicken. Yum. 


Here’s one of the English comments you’re probably looking for 
Pure goat he’s eaten :( I don’t like watching this video when the goat died
That looks yummy

Copying a recipe is not a survival skill! Neither is city girls shooting in a village setting.
They prepared a location to properly prepare the animal. They also dressed the animal and prepared it responsibly. Following proven method is showing intelligence on their part. Why would they reinvent the wheel. What's you problem Jealous much Where's your video No need to tell me. I'm not interested because your energy is bogus and suspect.

Hello... I love your traditional cooking video but it would be great to be able to watch the subtitled videos since not in all countries there are the ingredients that you use or rather do not look the same and can not be recognized with the naked eye. 
My advice would be that as an ingredient table specify your name in English as subtitles. 
E só eu que tenho dó dos Bichinhos ou mais alguém 

This so sad may i eat you
Pls give name for all product

Q 
Sam the cooking guy beginning of 2020: We will be cooking more healthy meals! 
Sam the cooking guy three months into 2020:


“God I hope this is big enough.” - that’s what she said
With years of cooking experience youd think the chef would know that anything hot off the stove would be too hot to put directly in your mouth 

Also Sam: Wrap that shit in cheese
As soon as I get the notification I know it's time for:
1.  Massive bong hits
There's actually some guy in California that's been doing these for years.


Me: I'm just gonna chill and make myself what I call a Sam cooked burrito

Love the video! Take care! :)
I can binge watch you all day.  And your smart ass comments are hilarious.
Why is this under the “easy dinner recipes” playlist

“Lowkey burritos” give him credit tf

Sam: ummmm....1

Maybe a large glass of ice water just outside of Sam's reach would add a little more drama to when Same puts smoking hot food in his mouth!

This looks amazing!

My doctor said my cholesterol was high so he prescribed  blocking Sam's burrito videos lmao!
Looks amazing. Next time try some Hot Picante!! It’s amazing in them! Don’t kill me in the next episode for asking you to add something lol! See you Friday!


For once I'm with Max. I'm 5 too cause I laughed!

There’s a man in DTLA that makes these. One of the tastiest things I’ve ever tried.
Edit: https://www.yelp.com/biz/lowkey-burrito-los-angeles-2 there’s the link for anyone who’s in the LA area that wants to try it.

Wild hair up his ass was correct according to the way I've always heard it...
Can we get a shirt that says:
“ASTRO!”
#NAME?


yeah clogged arteries is what you've got lul
This is how my favorite breakfast place makes their hash browns...I actually just go there for the hash browns lol mmmm 
It’s a wonder that Sam can even taste anything. His taste buds must be so destroyed after eating so much hot stuff
It's so wrong that it's right.
Sam- “God I hope this is big enough” 
Me waiting for max to redeem himself. “What she said”

Doctor: Why do I see cheese crust around your heart
Me: forwards this video
I love that Sam burns his mouth almost every episode. Always cracks me up.
sam: the cooking guy
max: the camera guy

Sam is clearly trying to kill me! In a good way 

 EGGS



Him: Shutcho mouf!
You’re a mad scientist


(Burns mouth and swears)
Me: Does he never learn 


and  I thought I was the only one who turned sausage with their fingers. Now its me and Sam!!

" that’d be totally tubular!"""""";"
im pretty sure every person watching knew you were gonna burn the shit outta your mouth biting that sausage lmao
You had my like at : “WRAP IT IN A CRISPY CHEESY LAYER OF DELICIOUSNESS” 
What's the deal about smashing the like button Is it ok if I just click on it 

Way ahead of you Sam 

Went to the doc yesterday and found out my BP and cholesterol were high so I decided to go on a strict diet...and today you post this. Thanks a lot Sam! 

Put the grilled cheese layer on the INSIDE of the burrito!
Sam seasons eggs before cooking
Gordon Ramsey Has entered the chat

I was today years old when Sam the Cooking Guy taught me to cut the ends off of a potato when peeling.
When he ate the brat when it was hot

I go to San Diego every night for work and I never knew where your restaurant was lol



Sam remember when you said we where going to eat healthy this year lol
You make me miss America.  Im going to cook so much of your food fo r my girlfriend when I am home! #cheeseineverything
That looked so delish Sam! Does it damage the EVO when you chop or slice things on it

..umm...
mannn i swear i watch u more then everybody

I’m dying laughing over the “smash” that button!  thinking of Sam saying I will never say smash abs subscribe in the same sentence.  LOL good job Max



Damn Sam!  That burrito looks outstanding!  Flavor out the wazoo!

Just pre-ordered my knife. Thanks for the amazing videos!!! 
Heck no! That meat needed to be left cooking hours longer. That meat was hard couldn't of had flavor. Rest looked good tho.
Almost at 2 million subs and you can't put subtitles  Come on girl !!!
I wish my fam like this.  Soup looks soo good. 
Even with the great power of editing this should have stayed longer in the fire. Not the best execution to what is usually a simple dish to make.
I feel that the middle women is always eating more... & will say bye bye at the end

The tittle is click bait it's supposed to say Cow Bone Soup 
Ewwww these ppl literally eat anything

These videos really help alot hay...especially when im.in  hurry the 5 minutes meals are amazing
I don't watch this because I'm hungry i watch these because of satisfaction...

Title: Egg
Video: Chicken
Me: But Chicken isn't e-
My last two brain cells: Chicken comes from an egg
Me: comes to see something easy and delicious
Video: has ingredients I don't have
Me: well imma head out 
I'm just watching this knowing that I won't do a single thing in this video.

Place your egg on your table with no plate
Me: wait isn't that illegal
This is like 5 minute crafts but the crafts are good and they’re food
I’ve never eaten a steamed egg...
damn making me hungry at 11:36 pm-
it was a mistake to click on this but i like it-
everyone: why am I watching this knowing that I am not hungry
me:

Me: watching video 12 ways to cook an egg
Also me: allergic to eggs
The comments seem to be from many different time zones.
OMG  it making me hungry.... at 2 am (korea)
i gonna cook now! haha
my first time this early on a tasty video and damn the comment section is as bland as masterchef kitchen foods
Gordon s gonna come after them after seeing their scrambled egg recipe 
0:19 lmao my mom gave my sister noodles and since I am  on a diet she gave me those loll but if you put some sauce in it it is being perfect 
“12 Amazing Ways To Cook Your Eggs”
Me: *Makes a raw egg shot*
What has this become 5 min craft
1 am now . And I don't regret clicking.
how to cook an egg with steps:

People allergic to eggs be like:
How to basic wants to know your location...
This year I plan to cook every dish I see.... eventually. Before the end of the year anyway. :) That I can eat without becoming ill for one reason or another. 
Tasty keeps recycling because they know its good for the environment
When you have none of these ingredients but you still watch these videos....
Idk why i watch these as of I’ll ever actually make them
Is it just me sitting in bed just watching these knowing imma never gonna make it and just making myself hungry
why does all their food look so good. ITS SORCERY!!
If you see my comment..I hope your dreams come true.

This fast food would take most people a very long time to make....
Fast food- let it rest for 1 hour. 

I’ve found a simpler way of making all of these
Step1: Get in your car
Step2: Buy fast food cause it’s cheaper than getting all these ingredients
That is one bland pizza! Where’s the rest of the cheese Any other toppings SOMEthing more than sauce and a little bit of Parmesan
Me : OH I'll make this!
Also me: looks through kitchen and only finding salt and pepper
Me again: screw it.

I love how their suggestion thing blocks out at least 3 ingredients at 0:38 nice advertising.
Finally I can cook at home for my siblings
Me at 3:00 am trying not to starve

Also me:
the amount of times you have posted the same video of the wings...

Why do I always watch these videos with an empty stomach
Sigh it's probably fast for them but slow for me lol 


I need to stop coming to this channel while stoned...
Well every time i eat those dishes 
MY TUMMY FELL NICE
BUT AFTERWARDS 
im literally on a diet where i cant eat anything here still watching tho

Hey Tasty..I This..Have you ever seen a cake made from off the charcoal grill I DID

Ya know what’s funny...I saw all of these on the channel and already made them (vEgAn oF cOuRsE)
2:42 I never knew buffaloes had wings...
Its good to see that they actually toasted the he hamburger bun. Thank you
When making fried chicken. 
Thank you for making this video I'm not quite sure why people are leaving such negative comments if they don't like they can simple stop watching.

I tried swai and enjoyed it very much. Thank you.
Just cook the thing already haaa

Great video!  I've never had much luck cooking fish but this looks like it will work well for me!  Thank you!

 
I'd starve to death waiting on this guy to cook food. So he adds more salt with sea salt and the garlic salt has salt in it. My goodness alive! Would you like a little fish with your salt
I think it needs more spice! 
" thanks. I will buy more Swai just to do this recipe!"""""";"
Have you looked up swai
Great Video  Fish Looks  so yummy thank You:)
This was hard to watch
how did you like the fish with your spices
I added all the ingredients you did minus the bread crumbs and fried them in coconut oils and it was fabulous... thank you so much...
Can you make swai fish and chips I would like to see that
How much time on each side in the pan
That is so yummy thx
Great vid
Great video
Looks as good as a fish you would get at a fine restaurant.
All the spices you used up to the dill are exactly what we do to our fish before frying it in India. Instead of the dill we use cumin powder. We then dredge the fish in bread crumbs and shallow fry. Swai is my favorite fish. Fortunately for me swai nuggets have become really cheap at Walmart.
Have made plenty of swai and like it it's different and really filling but not a heavy filling like steak would be. Give it a try and if it's not raw don't worry about anything...if steak was raw you'd have to worry about parasites anyways. Silly people. I'll give your rub a try!


Great video. I hope you threw out those spices you contaminated!
OMG I think I'm scared  to cook my swai fish tonight... It's my 1st time and don't wanna get my family sick OMG 


I roll it in cornmeal and fry it like catfish.We like it better not fishy tasting.about half the price of catfish.
what the price per kilo of swai
Worse tasting fish I ever had.  I ate one quarter of a fillet and dump the rest in the garbage.
Wtf horrible

That olive oil brand should either cut you a check or give you a free shipment.



Really liked the video. Definitely think adding the voice over helped understand how you were prepping the food. Would be great to see that in future meal prep videos. The chicken sausage looked really good. Might have to make that for my food prep this weekend!!
You really need to start a meal prep business. You're a great cook and seem to really enjoy it. Love the video!
I just love the way he outlines everything. It really helps you when grocery shopping and trying to get back on track. Awesome channel!!
I’m 65 and love your style. You get on with it and makes me want to watch your videos. Keep up the good work. Thanks for caring and sharing and be blessed by Almighty God from above!! 

I'm so happy to find you. I like the way you explains and make it very easy to understanding. keep going boy.  Thanks so much
I feel like people would watch a 3 hour live stream of you cooking 
Wow this is truly amazing ! I'm definitely going to step up my meal prep game
Love your meal prep videos!!! You are so organized My kitchen looks like a war zone when I'm meal prepping!!  Also what pre workout do you recommend for women
You're adorable I call dibs
This was awesome! Do you freeze your meals for the week or just refrigerate 
Love your meal prep videos so much! They are great instruction wise and keep me motivated to do meal prep! Thank you! God Bless you and your efforts!
Love these videos and forever will be a waterjugfitness supporter!! Thank you for all the hard work you do!! And my firehouse thanks you too we do meal prep every week because of you!! :)


New subbie ! Omg tho everything looks so yummy I can smell it ! Anyways I will definitely be trying those chicken sausages they looked so good ! And I'm guessing healthy ! Yum
Love the meal ideas! Thank you


BUT YOU DO A LOT OF COOKING IN ONE  TIME. 'EVEN FOR OTHERS' ALMIGHTY GOD BLESS YOU.
Thanks for the voice over !!! I listen to your videos at work for meal prep ideas  Good stuff 
Probably one of my favorite food prep style videos so far (since i watch them all lol) and i will have to agree with my sister Nik P about the chicken sausage!
I like the voice overs simply because i can listen to you videos while I work. Thank you. I am saving this video to listen to at work tomorrow.

Well done 
Keep it up 
Excellent video thank you . Meal Prep Goals!
Love the added voiceover with info. I prefer to hear it rather than read it. Great job on all the meals....you definitely are stepping up prep!!
Helpful video!! 
Is olive oil ok to use when cutting 
Try thawing out meats before u start anything else. So by the time you need them they are soft.

Great job! Loved the video.
got damn.how long does it take you to meal prep everything.and by the way fantestic vid man.you sir have a lot patience.
Another awesome meal prep video! You make it look so easy! ...hey do you ever re-use those  pans They always seem new...but I would assume you could use maybe your broccoli pans over or something
I find your channel so helpful on how different me and my partner should be eating :) thanks for including a girls one in the video too. I always know how much I should be eating but figuring it out for him is hard
do u have a set workout plan and where could i find it
I like your video but i need swtich the volume constantly because the music too loud



Lol! Film protector. I would have left it on though. 
Stellar video! Loved it. I liked your cooking methods for the chicken and fries
Do u eat rice every week

Great video! Always informative and entertaining.
I  it!! I'm enjoying your video...xo
My meal prep game has gotten so strong thanks to you! Great video.
All that oil  awesome mealprep. Btw who's Alex If he's a roomate/brother he's damn lucky to have you making all the food so's your sister. Duude can I adopt you 
Great video and thumbs up for the metric system :D

Needed this. I’m prepping for myself and my husband which is hard and our kids. Glad I’m not the only one doing so many. Also your personality reminds me of my husband.
The voice over is working in terms of better comprehension. 
Yes. snacks.
I really like that I-talian medley.
I stumbled up on your videos about 2wks ago while surfing youtube and been tuned in ever since.. I also would like to know if you could include workouts and eating days for women.. Ive been following your lower calorie cutting meal prep plans so far..

How do you not have a million subscribers yet I don't understand society ... Keep up the great work!
Omg you make it look so easy but what a great heart u have for cooking and videoing all same time pat on the back for you now one day I'll be as great as you Thanks for the ideal meals now it's my turn yikes wish me luck 
Your hairstyle tho! :)
Awesome prep video. Love that you do both male a female portions.
I really enjoy these videos. U do a great job.
God bless you from pakistan
What kind of dressing do you put on your salad

how do you count the macros on the oil
Love the video bro! Did your barber/stylist cut a little too much from the right side of your head
You make prepping look easy.  I'm going to meal prep today.
He looks like Frank Mir


Always love your videos. I'd say I prefer this style the best. Especially since I like to listen more than watch when I'm actually cooking.  I appreciate you taking the time to do this lol now if I could only convince you to meal prep for me  I second whoever suggested creating your own meal prep service!
Can you share a link for the rice cooker you use please

Hey man. I was wondering what are the specific macros and sodium on the salmon for 1 serving size
Where are your pans from Trying to find good ones online. Btw thank you again for great videos! :)

So you are having 5 of those meals per day
How long did it take you
I'm going to try seasoning my sweet potatoes the way you do.
Lol been there. The one thing about meal prep is it takes a few hours. I'm trying to figure out ways to cut down the cooking time. So far I buy pre chopped veggies when possible and i batch my protein cooking into a single 1.5 hour round (chicken and veg). Rice and lentils take less time to cook but should be done early so you dont wait as long for them to cool down.

Last sosege from the binging looks like a pines with condom

How well does the salmon keep in the fridge through the week

great video!!!

Dam bruh... they better pay u extra for all that food plus they messing with ur sleep gains...
I like the voiceover! I also like the way you cut up your veggies- you include the white part (which is the best part in my opinion). I always enjoy watching your videos. I can't wait for your next vlog :D
How did your sweet potatoes fries came out   I done it once and it was all soggy and burnt . Any suggestions :]  Thanks 
And what is the nutritional facts for the salmon  I enjoy your meal prepping !
On an Eco note:  Do you reuse the foil pans or the portioning dishes  Seems like it could get expensive if you don't.

would love to see a meal plan video on PCOS food. about 1 in 10 women suffer from it.
What is the brand of your scale
Solid prep
You are awesome

How long do u keep salad before it goes bad
Great video
those are aluminium pans. nobody uses tin anymore.:)

I hate health problems..
Does the fish make your house smell

Seas best salmon not talapia
How this is possible that all those meals can keep fresh for more then 3-4 days in the fridge
Especially veggies sweet potato or broccoli.
I'm asking cause I'm going to start preparing that kind of boxes but until now I was freezing my meals.
Is it good to eat like this... Kinda frozen food.....
Hey Jeff sorry i haven't commented In a while but I've been busy the whole month looking for my lost dog. BTW Great video keep it up!!

How do you count the fats from the Olive oil since it is in almost every thing you cook Have you tried Avacado Oil Cold Pressed.

“Seasoning”
My brain: why I season my cast iron before I cook my steak
This music is making it difficult to stay awake. Now I have that to worry about also with the hunger issues recently presented
Who just watches these vids and never actually try the recipes

My mom legit just surprised me with a cast iron skillet!!!! Wow
Someone please tell me where can I find this music. 
Loving the background music...
I still have my granny cast iron that was made in the factory in Oakland from the 70's

Why was the brussel sprouts recipe so soothing

I watch cast iron's videos just for the girl's voice over :)
Whats better than lying on the bed at night and watching tasty
I don’t even have one and yet here I am. 
That One Vegan at the Party: Nervous Sweating

When your so happy you think your the first comment but then you see 1 other comment
Tasty is not gonna give this comment a heart trust me
FIRST
Whos a better chef 
1. Gordon Ramsay
2. Tasty
Ya LOL
 
All that's missing is some cranberry sauce with lots of sumac.
*bon appetite has entered the chat
For thanksgiving tasty should make a bunch of good food then give it to the homeless people 
The turkey recipe isn’t that different from Bon Appétit
i saw another comment on this but srsly when tasty makes all this food and comes out with a new food video every hour they should give it to homeless shelters.

Whaaat I thought they’ll show the gravy ran out 
All i have is salt. I'm having salt for thanks giving
Is nobody going to mention that he cuts the turkey on the table
I can see David slaving away in the kitchen for us already... 

I really wanted to see the inside of the little potato mountains
I wanted to see a cross section of the potato being cut!
I’m here while it still says no views
This looks delicious but mac and cheese is required in my house lol
Real-talk that turkey IS perfect. I made the recipe last year and it changed me (and my family's) life...
Those potato things are not for Thanksgiving. Too much work and I'd rather just have fluffy mashed potatoes.

Imagine seeing THIS in your refrigerator 
I wish I had smell-o-vision on my phone 
When you thought u clicked on a safiya vid
i can't listen to the music because it reminds me so much of safiya
It feels weird that the song goes on and doesn’t stop and saf saying “hello friends”
I thought this was a Safiya vid for a moment
I thought I was looking at a Safiya vid and got hella confused lmao
I was expecting a:

What tf did they do to safiya
This is the comments section practically is made up of:
99%- about how they thought this video was made by Safiya 
1%- about their opinion
Hm...interesting intro-I mean-background song choice. 
Safiya's Intro Song
i like how everyone thought they clicked on a safiya vid cus it's her intro song lol
insert joke about Safiya intro music here
When you thought u clicked on a safiya video 
The Safiya music confused me....
The moment when you realise you never knew the back part of the background music bc safiya’s intro only has the front part lol.
I was so confused at the beginning I though I had accidentally clicked on safiyas video 
For a moment there i thot it was a Safiya video...
“Wait did I click on Safiya's video”
“NEW VIDEO :D”
“Oh... No just pancakes”
This is making me so uncomfortable. It's like a never ending Safiya's intro 
Literally every single comment:
Omg I thought this was Safiya’s video!
